## üìô Description

Colly is a web-based application designed for effortlessly collecting and organizing your favorite URL's and websites.

One of Colly's features is its tagging system, which allows users to categorize and organize their collections with ease.
Whether it's articles, blogs, tutorials, or any other web content, users can assign relevant tags to each link,
enabling efficient retrieval and navigation within their collections.

The collection of a user can also be set as public and accessed using a public access link by
anyone who has the link.

Whether you're a student, professional, or simply someone who loves to explore the web,
Colly empowers users to create curated collections tailored to their unique preferences and interests.

## üñ• Usage

### Setup & requirements

The back-end of the application is written using Node.js and the Express framework, while
the front-end part uses React.

are required. Its access credentials need to be configured using the environment variables below.

#### Deploy using Docker

The recommended way to deploy Colly is using its [Docker](./Dockerfile) image.

The image can be pulled from the
[GitHub Packages registry](https://github.com/users/jarne/packages/container/package/colly)
